### Refactoring Ruby Edition - code accompaniment

The plaintext code snippets in "Refactoring: Ruby Edition" got too hard for me to follow so here's a repo with the sample code painstakingly (and error prone-ly) typed out. Seriously I couldn't even copy them from the Kindle edition; it's all just pictures.

If you find a better source for this online please let me know. I had a little Google with no success.
